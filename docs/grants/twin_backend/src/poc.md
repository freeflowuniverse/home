## Proof of Concept

- Building first primitives
    - Implement first functionalities inside Domain Specific Language
        - Find a digital twin by his twin_id (or handle)
            - Request connection permission 
                - Approve
                - Create trusted circles with pairs of digital twins 
                - Deny permission 
                - Revoke permission 
        - Start message chat with another digital twin 
            - Send a text message (no interface)

- Expand and solidify phase (primitive DSL) 
    - _Connect with different blockchains through the digital twin _
    - _Exchange files using the decentralized grid _
    - _Permission access layer to specific files inside my cloud storage_
    - _Interface UI/UX_
    - _Deploy production Digital Twin on the decentralized grid _
    - _The first production uses cases (alternative zoom, WhatsApp, storage)

- Build dAPP to set us free from big corporation services 
    - Alternative to Spotify 
    - Alternative Airbnb 
    - Alternative Uber eats
    - Alternative TicketMaster
